Example inclusive contribution guidelines for open source projects

## :pushpin: Why

Recent history in some prominent open source projects demonstrates that there is an ongoing problem in
creating inclusive open source communities where all members feel comfortable contributing their talents
and efforts. Because open source work is often carried out on a volunteer basis, it is vital that
potential contributors feel welcome and encouraged to do so. On a pragmatic level, this must be balanced
with the high workload that project leaders and frequent contributors (sometimes called "core committers")
face in maintaining open source projects. We believe a stronger, more valuable community and development
process can be enabled by clear documentation and guidelines.

## :pushpin: What this repository is

Many open source projects solicit and encourage contributions and seek to provide guidelines for doing so.
GitHub even provides a mechanism for presenting these guidelines during the collaboration process in the
form of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://help.github.com/articles/how-do-i-set-up-guidelines-for-contributors).
Often times, however, these guidelines are strictly of a technical nature, as in coding standards, or a
legal nature, as in CLAs (contributor license agreements).

Additionally, contributor guidelines should clarify the types of contributions that are considered valuable,
the process by which such contributions are accepted, and the community standards surrouding the discussion of
proposed contributions. In doing so, these guidelines should seek to be as inclusive as possible and
seek to create a safe, positive environment which values all contributions which seek to improve the project.
